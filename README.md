# WEB BUDGETING APP
This budgeting app is a web application for tracking expenses. The app stores all the data in the local storage of the user making it possible for the user to retrieve the data.

The first web page has all the major expenses that a user could incur, for example, housing, transport, phone, etc. It also has an addition button which allows the user to add any income to the app.

The first page also has a subtraction button that allows the user to add any other expense that is not listed in the main buttons.

At the bottom of the first page, there is a balance button which on click shows how much income is left. On both sides of this button is a burger-like button which on click, will lead you to the second page of the app.

The second page of the app displays all the expenses of the user both in a pie-chart form and in a table.

When a user hovers over the different sections of the pie chart, they will be able to see the different percentage of each expense. The percentages are calculated as a percent of a certain expense to the total income.

The table shows the date an income was added or when an expense was incurred. The last row of the table shows the outstanding balance which is the income minus all the expenses.
